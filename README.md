# 10 Week AI

A web application designed to help you track and manage your progress through a 10-week AI mastery curriculum. This project serves as a "Vibe Code Kickoff" deliverables tracker and a central hub for your journey from AI preparation to building AI-powered applications.

## Description

The **10 Week AI** app acts as a personal learning management system for the "10 Week AI" curriculum. It guides users through four distinct phases:
1.  **Preparation**: Setting up the necessary accounts and infrastructure.
2.  **The Foundations**: Building initial apps, comparing models, and conducting deep research.
3.  **Visuals & Information**: Creating visual reasoning projects and information pipelines.
4.  **Automation & Systems**: Implementing output/input automations and context engineering.
5.  **The Build**: Creating a final app with AI integration.

The application allows users to view weekly content, track completed tasks, and visualize their schedule.

## Features

*   **Interactive Curriculum**: A structured view of all 10 weeks (plus setup and bonus weeks), including descriptions, tools, key insights, and deliverables.
*   **Progress Tracking**: Mark tasks as complete and track your overall progress. Data is persisted locally so you pick up where you left off.
*   **Dashboard**: A high-level overview of your current status and upcoming tasks.
*   **Calendar View**: Visualize the timeline of the curriculum.
*   **Resource Listing**: See which AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) are recommended for each specific week.
*   **Responsive Design**: Built with React and Tailwind CSS to work seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
